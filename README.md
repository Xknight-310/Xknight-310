# Hi, I'm Xknight-310 👋

## 👨‍🎓 About Me
I'm a curious student passionate about technology and learning new things. I enjoy tackling exciting challenges, building cool projects, and expanding my skillset every day.

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Python** (my strongest language!)
- **C++** (learning and exploring)
- **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Electron** (currently working on an app!)

## 🚀 Current Project
I'm actively developing an Electron app—bringing together my love for web technologies and desktop applications.

## 🏐 Fun Fact
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me playing **korfball**! It keeps me energized and brings balance to my life.
